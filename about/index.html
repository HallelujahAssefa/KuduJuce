                <h1>WHAT DOES KUDUJUCE MEAN?</h1>
                <p class="kuduP">Kudujuce (Koo-do-juice) is the name I created to describe the hidden power of digital
                    marketing and
                    search engine optimization in particular.

                    A Kudu is a sub-species of antelope found in eastern and southern Africa. These animals are very
                    powerful and graceful in their own subtle way. They don’t have the obvious power and strength of a
                    predator like a lion but a grace and speed that may not be so evident if you’re not paying
                    attention.

                    I saw many kudus while traveling in Botswana and Namibia. Search Engine Optimization reminds me of a
                    Kudu, the power of SEO is not in your face like other methods but when done correctly it is very
                    powerful. That’s the juce we inject into our client’s websites to expand their digital footprint.
